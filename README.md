# UPS-Compliance-Workdocs
Documentation of compliance, safety management, and OSHA regulatory procedures in a high-volume logistics environment.

This document highlights my experience in compliance, safety management, and risk assessment at UPS, with a focus on OSHA compliance, process optimization, and incident response. While I don’t currently work in software testing, I plan to apply my systematic approach to problem-solving—including risk evaluation, regulatory enforcement, and operational streamlining—to software quality testing and cybersecurity. My skills in systematic testing, documentation, and security auditing are essential for ensuring software integrity and compliance.
