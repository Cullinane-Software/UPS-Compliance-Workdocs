# UPS-Compliance-Workdocs
Documentation of compliance, safety management, and OSHA regulatory procedures in a high-volume logistics environment.

This document outlines my compliance, safety management, and risk assessment experience at UPS, focusing on OSHA compliance, process optimization, and incident response. The structured approach I use to evaluate risks, enforce regulations, and streamline operations aligns with software quality testing and cybersecurity. These skills—systematic testing, documentation, and security auditing—are essential for ensuring software integrity and compliance.
